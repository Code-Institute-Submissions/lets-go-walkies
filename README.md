# Let's Go Walkies


Let's Go Walkies is a site that introduces people and their pets to a dog hiking group based in the north west of england. The site offers open and free information regarding events and allows people to sign up for event newsletters and updates. Let's Go Walkies is aimed at dog owners that enjoy socialising their pets and those who might prefer group walks and hikes as oppose to solitary ones. The aim of the site is to aid the growth of the community and to give dog walkers potential new ideas as to suitable dog friendly areas to take their dogs.

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

### Validator Testing 

MAKE SURE TO DO THE VALIDATOR CHECKS AGAIN ONCE ALL SITE FEATURES ARE IMPLIMENTED!!!!!! ADD SCREENSHOTS OF ALL VALIDATOR SCORES FOR ALL PAGES

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
